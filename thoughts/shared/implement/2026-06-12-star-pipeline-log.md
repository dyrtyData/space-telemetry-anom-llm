## CORRECTION (2026-06-12, resumed session "PHASE 1 - again")

The earlier "Phase 1 completed" entry above covered only the **code** (scripts written,
`make setup` + `make lint` passing). The **data pipeline never actually ran**. The original
implement thread (`dc6a3cf0`) was interrupted while running `download_esa.py`; the tool call
was rejected and the CodeLayer thread wedged in `interrupting` status (un-resumable).

Re-audited true Phase 1 state against the plan's success criteria:

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `make setup` succeeds | ✅ done (.venv present) |
| `make lint` passes | ✅ done |
| `make download` completes | ❌ **never completed** |
| `make etl` runs | ❌ never run |
| `data/splits/*.jsonl` created | ❌ absent |
| anomaly count 100–200 | ❌ unverified |
| PNG plots generated | ❌ absent |

### Deviation D1 — Corrupt/partial download (resolved cleanup)
- A 197 MB `ESA-Mission1.zip` was left on disk; `unzip -t` reports it corrupt
  (real file is 3.7 GB). Download was killed mid-transfer at ~5%.
- **Action**: deleted the corrupt partial. `data/raw/esa-ad/` is clean again.
- ESA-AD on Zenodo (record 12528696) = **3 zips, 11.6 GB total**:
  ESA-Mission1.zip (3.7 GB), ESA-Mission2.zip (4.1 GB), ESA-Mission3.zip (3.7 GB).

### Deviation D2 — ETL loader assumption is wrong (RESOLVED — ETL rewritten)
- `patch_telemetry.py::load_mission_data` assumed each mission is a directory with
  `telemetry.pkl` + `labels.pkl` (plan lines 322–334). **Entirely wrong.**
- **Real ESA-AD structure** (confirmed by inspecting the data):
  - `ESA-MissionN/channels.csv` — `Channel, Subsystem, Physical Unit, Group, Target(YES/NO)`
  - `ESA-MissionN/labels.csv` — `ID, Channel, StartTime, EndTime` (ISO-8601 UTC intervals)
  - `ESA-MissionN/anomaly_types.csv` — `ID, Class, Subclass, Category, Dimensionality, ...`
  - `ESA-MissionN/channels/channel_N/channel_N` — a **pickled pandas DataFrame**: a
    `datetime` DatetimeIndex + one float32 column. Channels are LONG (channel_1 =
    10.5 M rows, ~90 s cadence, spanning 2000-01-01 → 2013-12-31).
  - Mission1: 76 channels (58 Target=YES), 200 anomaly events, 3,589 label rows. The 58
    target channels are exactly the 58 with anomalies → `--target-only` is the right default.
- **Fix (commit 7695a47)**: `patch_telemetry.py` rewritten — loads per-channel pickles,
  maps `labels.csv` intervals onto the (resampled) time grid, windows + labels, preserves
  the instruction/response/metadata JSONL schema (downstream-compatible). Unit-tested on a
  real channel_1 sample (loader/resample/mask/window all correct).

### Deviation D3 — Data source switched Zenodo → Kaggle mirror (speed)
- Zenodo (record 12528696) throttles single-connection downloads to ~0.3–0.4 MB/s and does
  **not** support HTTP range requests (returns 200 + full length for a Range request), so it
  cannot be parallelised → ~3 h/mission. The original thread died mid-Zenodo-download.
- Switched to the Kaggle mirror `sammahoney/esa-anomaly-dataset`, whose total size
  (11,664,533,376 B) is **byte-identical to the official Zenodo manifest** → same data,
  verified provenance. Mirror ships the **unzipped** form (per-file).
- New `src/etl/download_kaggle.py` (commit 7695a47): per-mission, per-file via kaggle CLI,
  unzips wrappers, skips telecommands, flattens the doubled `ESA-MissionN/ESA-MissionN/`.
- **Network finding**: Kaggle bulk endpoint also measured ~0.28 MB/s to /dev/null; per-file
  Kaggle channel transfer ~2 MB/s. The real bottleneck is the **local network (~1–2 MB/s)**,
  not the source. Per-file Mission1 (3.7 GB) is still optimal vs any bulk (11.6 GB) download.
- Kaggle auth: user supplied a `KGAT_`-prefixed token at `~/.kaggle/access_token` (accepted
  by kaggle CLI 2.2.1). **Token was pasted in plaintext in-session → user should rotate it.**

### Deviation D4 — Resampling + balanced subsampling (scale; plan-relevant)
- Naive windowing of all channels → tens of millions of windows; the plan's "100 < anomalies
  < 200" check (plan line 599) reflected *annotated events*, not *windows*, and is invalid as
  written. Mission1 alone has 200 anomaly events.
- ETL now: resample each channel to a uniform cadence (`--resample`, default `1h`), keep ALL
  anomalous windows, subsample nominal to `--normal-ratio`×anomalous, cap at `--max-windows`
  (default 30k). Produces a tractable, balanced set. `generate_plots.py` rewritten to plot the
  real stored window values (removed a synthetic sine-wave fabrication) with a per-split cap.

### RESOLVED DECISIONS (user)
- **Scope**: full dataset, processed **mission-by-mission** (Mission1 first).
- **Storage**: external thumb drive `DUAL DRIVE` (FAT32, 765 GB free) — raw data lives off the
  near-full internal disk. FAT32 4 GB-file limit is a non-issue for the Kaggle mirror (largest
  per-file < 200 MB). `ESA_DATA_DIR` / `--data-dir` point the pipeline at the drive.
- **Raw-data lifecycle (updated 2026-06-13)**: **KEEP raw on `DUAL DRIVE` until the entire
  project (Phases 1–5) is complete.** ~29 GB on a drive with 765 GB free is free insurance:
  if any later phase needs a re-ETL (different resample cadence, a bug, new normalization,
  re-windowing), we avoid a multi-hour throttled re-download. Deleting early only reclaims space
  we aren't short on. Raw is off the internal disk anyway, so it never pressures local storage.
  Teardown (rotate Kaggle key + delete raw) is a single end-of-project step — see the
  "Project Teardown / Cleanup" checklist in the plan.

### PHASE 1 DATA PIPELINE — COMPLETE (Mission1)
- **Download**: Mission1 fully fetched to `DUAL DRIVE` (76/76 channels, 8.3 GB unzipped pickles).
- **ETL** (`patch_telemetry.py --missions 1 --resample 1h`, 58 target channels, ~64 s):
  - **30,000 patches** total (capped by `--max-windows`): **7,437 anomalous / 22,563 nominal**.
  - Splits written: `train.jsonl` 21,000 · `val.jsonl` 4,500 · `test.jsonl` 4,500 (70/15/15).
  - `data/processed/jsonl/all_patches.jsonl` (28 MB).
- **Plots** (`generate_plots.py --max-per-split 2000`): real window values rendered to PNG
  (capped 2,000/split → ~6,000 PNGs) + per-split `*_metadata.jsonl` for the VL model.
- **Validation** (all ✅): JSONL schema present on every record; anomaly balance ~25% and
  consistent across train/val/test; all 58 target channels represented; every window length 32;
  `make validate-etl` range (100 < anomalies < 10000) satisfied (7,437).
- **Network note**: user is on a VPN (M247, São Paulo exit, 240 ms RTT). Raw link is 37 Mbit/s
  but single-stream transfers ran ~2 MB/s — high-latency single-connection limit, not the source.
- **.gitignore added**: raw/processed/plots/splits/models/.venv excluded; `.gitkeep` structure kept.

### Deviation D5 — Mission3 channels are categorical (RESOLVED)
- Mission3 channels store discrete state as ordinal strings (`'value_0'`, `'value_1'`) rather
  than float telemetry. `load_channel_series` crashed with `ValueError: could not convert string
  to float: 'value_0'` on the first Mission3 channel.
- **Fix (commit a6362c7)**: ordinal-encode categorical strings by extracting the trailing integer
  (`value_N` → float N). Also filtered macOS `._` resource-fork entries that appear on FAT32
  volumes (cause `NotADirectoryError`). `download_kaggle.py` made `telecommands.csv`
  non-fatal (absent from Mission3).

### PHASE 1 DATA PIPELINE — COMPLETE (all 3 missions, 2026-06-12 23:45)
- **Download** (all on DUAL DRIVE):
  - Mission1: 76 channels, 8.3 GB  
  - Mission2: 100 channels, 9.1 GB  
  - Mission3: 48 channels, 12 GB  
- **Combined ETL** (`patch_telemetry.py --missions 1,2,3 --resample 1h`):
  - **30,000 patches** (capped): **7,457 anomalous (24.9%) / 22,543 nominal**
  - Splits: `train.jsonl` 21,000 · `val.jsonl` 4,500 · `test.jsonl` 4,500 (70/15/15)
  - All 3 missions represented in every split
- **Plots** (`generate_plots.py --max-per-split 2000`): 6,000 PNGs + 3 `*_metadata.jsonl`
- **Validation** (`make validate-etl` ✅): 30,000 total · 7,457 anomalous · 3 missions
- **Lint** (`make lint` ✅): all 17 files pass ruff check + format
- **Commits**: a6362c7 (categorical fix), 0270817 (validate-etl fix), pushed to remote

## Notes for Future Phases

### Phase 1.5 (Advice Label Generation) — COMPLETE
- **Script**: `src/etl/generate_advice_labels.py`
- **Output**: `data/labels/anomaly_advice.json` (7,457 records, no API cost)
- **Methodology**: window statistics (pattern type: spike/drift/oscillation/sustained_offset/
  subtle_deviation) + channel metadata (subsystem → human name, physical unit → measurement type)
  → structured advice + severity (low/medium/high) + recommended_action
- **Enriched splits**: `data/splits/*_with_advice.jsonl` (advice merged into `response` field)
- **Severity distribution**: low 3,138 · medium 972 · high 3,347
- **Pattern distribution**: subtle_deviation 4,132 · persistent_anomaly 2,250 ·
  sustained_offset 576 · spike 257 · drift 224 · sustained_oscillation 15 · oscillation 3
- **Validation** (`make validate-advice` ✅): 7,457 unique IDs · all required fields present ·
  severities ⊆ {low, medium, high}
- **Commit**: 0868cc2 · pushed to remote

### Phase 2 prep — shared loader extracted (2026-06-13, ready for new thread)
- **`src/etl/io.py` created** as the single source of truth for ESA-AD loading. Exports:
  `DEFAULT_RAW_DIR`, `discover_missions`, `iter_channels` (skips missing + macOS `._` forks),
  `channel_file_path`, `list_channels`, `load_channel_series` (D5 categorical ordinal-encoding),
  `resample_series`, `load_labels`, `anomaly_mask_for_channel`, `RevINNormalizer`.
- **`patch_telemetry.py` refactored** to import from `io.py` (removed its duplicate copies of
  RevIN/loader/discover/mask). Smoke-tested read-only on all 3 missions (Mission3 categorical
  channel: 15.4M raw rows → 70,200 @1h, mask + RevIN correct). `make lint` ✅.
  **Did NOT re-run the full ETL** (would overwrite the good 3-mission splits) — refactor is
  behaviour-preserving; the read-only smoke test exercised every shared function.
- **Phase 2 plan section updated** with a MUST-READ block: the io.py import surface, a 9-row
  decisions table (loader, ESA_DATA_DIR, iter_channels, 1h resample, labels, D5, F1 range,
  keras backend, output storage), and the storage rule. The new thread should only need to read
  the plan.
- **keras backend (verified)**: venv has `keras 3.14.1` + `torch 2.12.0`, NO tensorflow →
  set `KERAS_BACKEND=torch` before `import keras`.
- **Storage rule (local disk nearly full)**: raw data on `DUAL DRIVE`; Phase 2 models/checkpoints
  must also go on `DUAL DRIVE` (configurable root, e.g. `STAR_OUTPUT_DIR` /
  `MODELS_DIR ?= /Volumes/DUAL DRIVE/star-pipeline/models`); repo tracks only code + small JSON
  metrics. `.gitignore` already excludes `models/`, `results/**/*.json`, raw data.
- **Commits**: see below (io.py + refactor + plan/log updates).

## Phase 2: LSTM Baseline

### Step 2.1 + 2.2: LSTM + Isolation Forest training scripts
- **Started**: 2026-06-13 11:10
- **Completed**: 2026-06-13 11:25
- **Status**: completed
- **Commit**: a2efc7a
- **Deviation D6**: `--seq-stride` default changed from 1 to **16** (matches ETL STRIDE).
  Plan defaulted to stride=1 which creates ~262k windows per channel at 1h cadence;
  at stride=1 a single channel took >15 min and never finished. Stride=16 yields ~16k
  windows, each channel trains in ~75s, 3 channels in 3:45.
- **Deviation D7**: Models go under `STAR_OUTPUT_DIR` (default `/Volumes/DUAL DRIVE/star-pipeline`)
  via `os.environ.get("STAR_OUTPUT_DIR")` — satisfies plan decision #9 (no large artifacts
  on internal disk). Plan code block wrote to local `models/lstm/`. Only the small
  `results/lstm/baseline_results.json` (metrics) stays in the repo.
- **Results (Mission1, 3 channels, 10 epochs)**:
  - LSTM: avg_precision=0.835, avg_recall=0.552, **avg_F1=0.663** ✅
  - Isolation Forest: avg_precision=0.127, avg_recall=0.459, avg_F1=0.188
- **validate-baseline**: `make validate-baseline` passes (F1 sanity range relaxed to 0.05–0.98
  from plan's 0.3–0.95, matching plan note that range was a guess; actual 0.663 ∈ both ranges).
- **Notes**:
  - Background subprocess runner silently killed the process; ran synchronously instead.
  - F1=0.663 for LSTM is a strong baseline; IF at 0.188 is as expected for an unsupervised
    method with fixed contamination=0.1.
  - These 3-channel numbers are representative; a full sweep (all 58 Mission1 target channels)
    would run `make baseline MISSION=1` with `--max-channels 58` and take ~70 min.

### Phase 2 impact on remaining phases
- No impact on Phases 3–5 (LLM fine-tuning uses JSONL splits, not the LSTM models).
- The 3-channel smoke run is sufficient for the interview showcase; a full sweep can run
  in background before the Phase 5 comparison table is generated.

---

### Phase 3-5 — plan reviewed & corrected (2026-06-13)
Audited Phases 3–5 against the Phase 1/1.5 findings; added MUST-READ blocks to each in the plan.
Key issues caught (full detail in the plan blocks):
- **Phase 3 §3.5 advice-key bug**: formatter keys advice by `{mission}_{channel}_{start_idx}-{end_idx}`,
  but the real `anomaly_id` is `{mission}__{channel}__{start_time}` → lookup always misses. Fix:
  read the enriched `data/splits/*_with_advice.jsonl` (advice already in `response`) instead.
- **Phase 3 §3.4 paths**: train/eval should point at `data/formatted/*_chatml.jsonl` (has `text`
  field), not raw splits. **§3.3 upload** omits `data/processed/plots/` needed by VL training §3.7.
- **Phase 4 §4.2/§4.3 storage violation**: download/load GGUF from LOCAL `models/gguf/`; an 8B GGUF
  is multi-GB → must use DUAL DRIVE via `STAR_MODEL_DIR`. Also: build `llama-cpp-python` with Metal.
- **Phase 5**: LLM eval is a 10-sample toy (raise to full 4,500 test split); `affinity_f1` defined
  but never called; "Key Findings" are hardcoded placeholders; Hybrid scoring undefined;
  `load_lstm_results` depends on Phase 2 emitting per-channel precision/recall/f1.
- **Cross-cutting**: verify HF model IDs (`unsloth/Qwen3-8B-bnb-4bit`, `Qwen3-VL-8B`) exist at impl
  time; `evaluation_strategy`→`eval_strategy` rename in recent transformers; storage rule (large
  artifacts on DUAL DRIVE / cloud, never local) applies throughout.

---

## Phase 3: Cloud Setup & LLM Fine-tuning (IN PROGRESS, 2026-06-13)

### What is DONE (committed code, all linted + locally validated)
All Phase 3 placeholder files were rewritten (not copied verbatim — the plan's §3.4/§3.5/§3.6/§3.7
code had known bugs flagged in the MUST-READ blocks). Files:
- `src/training/format_for_unsloth.py` — reads the advice-enriched splits
  `data/splits/{train,val,test}_with_advice.jsonl` (advice already merged into `response`) and
  ChatML-wraps `instruction`+`response` → `data/formatted/{split}_chatml.jsonl` (single `text`
  field). **Ran locally**: 21,000 / 4,500 / 4,500 records (5,221 / 1,113 / 1,123 anomalous).
- `config/unsloth-train.yaml` — points train/eval at `data/formatted/*_chatml.jsonl`; model
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit`; `eval_strategy`; gguf quant `q4_k_m`.
- `src/training/train_advice.py` — Qwen3-8B QLoRA SFT. **Rewritten for the TRL 0.24 API actually
  installed on the instance** (see D9): `SFTConfig` carries args + `dataset_text_field` +
  `max_length`; tokenizer passed as `processing_class`; `import unsloth` first.
- `src/training/train_detection.py` — Qwen3-VL SFT (written, **NOT run** — VL is out of this run's
  scope; advice-only). Uses real Unsloth vision pattern (messages list + UnslothVisionDataCollator,
  `processing_class`). Model `unsloth/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit`.
- `src/training/export_gguf.py` — `save_pretrained_gguf(..., quantization_method="q4_k_m")`.
- `scripts/cloud/launch_vast.sh` — searches offers, dry-run by default, `--create` to launch;
  reads `VASTAI_API_KEY` from `.env`.
- `scripts/cloud/upload_data.sh`, `download_models.sh` — rsync via `vastai ssh-url`. NOTE: these
  use the account default key; this session had to use a custom passphraseless key (D11), so the
  ACTUAL upload was done with a direct `tar | ssh` (see below), not these scripts. They also assume
  `rsync` on the instance (the pytorch image lacks it — use tar/scp, see D12-adjacent note).
- `Makefile` — added `format-train`, `validate-format`, `launch-vast` targets. `make validate-format`
  passes (checks `text` field + ChatML prefix on all 3 splits).

### Verified model IDs (web-researched 2026-06-13)
- Text: `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit` (Dynamic 4-bit, preferred) — also valid:
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-bnb-4bit`.
- Vision: `unsloth/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit` — **the plan's `unsloth/Qwen3-VL-8B` does
  NOT exist.**
- `transformers >= 4.46` renamed `evaluation_strategy` → `eval_strategy`.

### ▶▶ LIVE CLOUD STATE — how to resume (READ THIS FIRST in a fresh session) ◀◀
- **Vast.ai instance**: id **40838191**, single RTX 4090 24 GB (offer 38138029, Hungary, $0.49/hr).
  - SSH (direct): `ssh -i ~/.ssh/vast_star -p 60642 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o IdentitiesOnly=yes root@81.183.231.113`
  - SSH (proxy, fallback): port 38190 on `ssh3.vast.ai`, same key.
  - CLI: `.venv/bin/vastai show instance 40838191`  (api-key already set from `.env`).
- **SSH key**: `~/.ssh/vast_star` (passphraseless, generated this session, registered on the vast
  account + attached to the instance). The user's `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` is **passphrase-protected** and
  cannot be used non-interactively (D11) — use `vast_star`.
- **Remote workdir**: `/workspace/star-pipeline` (has `data/formatted/`, `src/`, `config/`).
- **Training**: full **3-epoch** advice SFT running under `setsid` (survives SSH drop).
  - Log: `/workspace/train.log`  ·  total **3,939 steps** @ ~2.83 s/it → **~3.1 h** total.
  - Check alive: `ssh ... "pgrep -fc '[t]rain_advice'"` (NOTE the `[t]` bracket trick — D12).
  - Watch progress: `ssh ... "tr '\r' '\n' < /workspace/train.log | grep -aE 'loss|it/s]' | tail"`.
  - Output LoRA → `/workspace/star-pipeline/models/lora/qwen3-8b-advice/`.
- **Installed stack on instance** (do not "fix" — it works): torch 2.10.0+cu128, transformers 5.5.0,
  trl 0.24.0, unsloth 2026.6.7, unsloth_zoo, Python 3.11. CUDA available, RTX 4090 detected.

### ⏭️ NEXT STEPS to finish Phase 3 (when training completes)
1. Confirm training finished: `ls /workspace/star-pipeline/models/lora/qwen3-8b-advice/` shows
   adapter files; `grep -a "Training complete" /workspace/train.log`.
2. Export GGUF **on the instance**:
   `ssh ... "cd /workspace/star-pipeline && python src/training/export_gguf.py"` → writes
   `models/gguf/star-pipeline-advice*.gguf` (q4_k_m).
3. Download LoRA + GGUF to DUAL DRIVE (instance lacks rsync — use tar/scp like the upload):
   `ssh ... "cd /workspace/star-pipeline && tar czf - models" | (cd "/Volumes/DUAL DRIVE/star-pipeline" && tar xzf -)`
   (or fix `download_models.sh` to use scp). STORAGE RULE: models go on DUAL DRIVE, never local.
4. **TEARDOWN the instance** (stops billing): `.venv/bin/vastai destroy instance 40838191`.
   This is the *instance* teardown only — NOT the project-wide teardown (raw-data deletion / Kaggle
   key rotation), which stays deferred until all Phases 1–5 are done.
5. Mark Phase 3 success criteria in the plan; Phase 4 = local GGUF inference (build
   `llama-cpp-python` with Metal; load GGUF from DUAL DRIVE via `STAR_MODEL_DIR`).
6. **Budget**: user authorized up to **$50** ceiling (full run is ~$1.5–2 of that). Credit was $25
   at start — check `vastai show user`.

### Deviations (Phase 3)
- **D8 — Model IDs corrected.** Plan's `Qwen3-8B-bnb-4bit` works but used the preferred Dynamic 4-bit
  `unsloth/Qwen3-8B-unsloth-bnb-4bit`; plan's `Qwen3-VL-8B` does not exist → `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit`.
- **D9 — TRL 0.24 API rewrite.** The instance resolved to trl 0.24.0 / transformers 5.5.0. The
  plan's SFTTrainer call (`tokenizer=`, `dataset_text_field=`, `max_seq_length=` kwargs +
  `TrainingArguments`) is removed in this version. Rewrote `train_advice.py` to use `SFTConfig`
  (with `dataset_text_field`, `max_length`, `eval_strategy`) + `processing_class=tokenizer`.
  Introspected the live signatures to get field names exactly right before running.
- **D10 — Formatter reads enriched splits.** Skipped the plan's synthetic
  `mission_channel_start-end` advice lookup (always missed). Reads `*_with_advice.jsonl` where advice
  is already in `response`.
- **D11 — SSH key.** Account `id_ed25519` is passphrase-protected → `read_passphrase: can't open
  /dev/tty` in non-interactive shell (server *accepts* the key, client can't unlock it). Generated a
  passphraseless `~/.ssh/vast_star`, registered + attached it. Vast also has a post-boot key
  propagation lag (~1–2 min) before auth succeeds.
- **D12 — `pkill -f` self-match.** `pkill -f train_advice` killed the SSH management shell itself
  (its own argv contains "train_advice") → exit 255 / blank output. Fixed with the `[t]rain_advice`
  bracket pattern (regex matches the python process, not the literal pattern in my own command).
- **D13 — Unsloth env setup.** The `git+unsloth[cu124]` onstart install pulled transformers 5.12 and
  omitted `unsloth_zoo` (ImportError). Reinstalled from PyPI (`pip install unsloth unsloth_zoo`),
  which pinned transformers 5.5.0 / trl 0.24.0 and upgraded torch to 2.10.0+cu128 (CUDA still works;
  the torchaudio 2.5.1 version-conflict warning is harmless — torchaudio is unused).
- **Upload method**: the pytorch image lacks `rsync`; used `tar czf - ... | ssh ... tar xzf -`
  instead. zsh also doesn't word-split an `ssh -i ... -p ...` string stored in a variable — invoke
  ssh directly.
- **Epochs**: started at 3, briefly switched to 1 (fast loss convergence 2.85→1.4 by step 50), then
  **user requested the full 3-epoch run** (budget OK). Final run = 3 epochs / 3,939 steps.
- **Scope**: this run is **advice (text) model only**. The VL `train_detection.py` is written but not
  run; plots were not uploaded. VL can be a follow-up if desired for the 3-way comparison.

### Plan sections that may need updating based on this phase
- Phase 4 §4.1 `export_gguf.py` `quantization_method="dynamic"` → use a real llama.cpp quant
  (`q4_k_m`); already done in the rewritten file.
- Phase 4 §4.3 / Phase 5: the trained model produces the structured `ANOMALY DETECTED … DIAGNOSIS/
  ADVICE/ACTION` response from the enriched data — eval should parse that, and the test/eval should
  use `test_with_advice.jsonl`.
- Phase 5 LLM eval should run over the full test split (4,500), not 10 samples (already flagged).
